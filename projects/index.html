      <h2>Introduction to Asante Twi</h2>
      <p>Asante Twi is one of the Akan languages spoken in Ghana, 
        primarily by the Asante people in the Ashanti Region. It is a 
        widely used language in the country and serves as a means of 
        communication for millions of Ghanaians.</p>

        <strong> Origins and Significance</strong>
        <p>
          Asante Twi belongs to the larger Akan language family, which
           includes other dialects such as Fante and Akuapem Twi. The 
           language has deep historical roots, dating back to the powerful Asante Kingdom, which was a dominant force in West Africa for centuries.
